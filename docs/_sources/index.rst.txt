Welcome to microkanrenst's documentation!
=========================================

This booklet is an extended description of :math:`\mu`-Kanren, a relational
interpreter formerly implemented in Scheme :cite:`hemann2013mukanren` and
ported in Smalltalk for the sake of understanding and, of course, fun. It
enjoys simplicity and elegance despite the complex nature of logic systems;
moreover, using an uniform but powerful language such as Smalltalk it is
possible to appreciate and benefit from both properties.
