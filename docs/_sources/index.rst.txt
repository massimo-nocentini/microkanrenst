=========================================

This booklet is an extended description of :math:`\mu`-Kanren, a relational

of understanding and, of course, fun. It enjoys simplicity and elegance despite
the complex nature of logic systems; moreover, using an uniform but powerful
language such as Smalltalk it is possible to appreciate and benefit from both
properties.
